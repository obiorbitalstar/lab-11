        'This book focuses on the analysis and design of reinforced concrete structures in conformity with CSA A23.3-04 Canadian standard. Such members are often encountered in engineering practice, particularly in buildings. Using an original approach, the authors present the subject matter as clearly and effectively as possible. Each aspect is carefully illustrated and is the subject of a thorough theoretical development. This is followed by a step-by-step procedure for both design and verification, along with many fully developped numerical applications.',
